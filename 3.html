        <p class="subtitle">
            Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) is a modern approach to resolving disputes 
            outside the traditional court system. It focuses on speed, cost efficiency, 
            confidentiality, and mutual agreement.

        <h2>Why choose Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR)</h2>
        <p>
            Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) is preferred because it offers faster resolution at lower legal costs while maintaining complete confidentiality. 
            Its flexible and informal process makes dispute handling smoother and less stressful, reduces the burden on courts, and encourages amicable settlements that help preserve relationships.

        <h2>Legal Framework for ADR in India</h2>
        <p>
            The legal framework for Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) in India is mainly governed by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, 
            which provides rules and procedures for arbitration and conciliation in both domestic and international disputes. The Act aims to ensure 
            fairness, speed, and minimal court interference in dispute resolution. In addition, Indian courts actively promote ADR through various 
            judgments and provisions under the Civil Procedure Code (Section 89), encouraging parties to opt for mediation, conciliation, or 
            arbitration before resorting to litigation.
