        <h1>ARBITRATION</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Arbitration is a method of dispute resolution in which 
            the parties agree to submit their dispute to a neutral third party, called an arbitrator, 
            who hears both sides and gives a binding decision that is enforceable by law</p>

        <h2><strong>Arbitration Cases</strong></h2>
        <h3><strong>Domestic Case</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <h3><strong>Air India Ltd. vs. Air India Employees Guild Arbitration Case (1985) - LANDMARK CASE</strong>
            </h3>
        <h4><strong>Parties</strong></h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Plaintiff: Air India Ltd. (PSU - National Carrier)</li>
        <li>Defendant: Air India Employees Guild (Recognized Union)</li>
        <li> Location: Mumbai + Delhi (National Level Dispute)
        <li>Management: Chairman Mr. R. Venkitaramanan + PSU Counsel</li>
        <li>Union: General Secretary Shri G. Ramanujam</li>
        <li>Workers Involved: 18,000 Cabin Crew + Ground Staff</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4><strong>Reason for Dispute</strong></h4>
        <p>The core issue was mass retrenchment and privatization fears, where Air India management planned a 25% workforce
         reduction affecting 4,500 jobs, while the union demanded no retrenchment without a Voluntary Retirement Scheme 
         (VRS) and guaranteed job security. Additional demands included a long-pending wage revision since 1981 with a 
         40% hike, complete elimination of the contract labour system in the PSU, and one-time settlement packages for 
         retiring staff. The dispute was triggered when Air India announced 1,200 immediate layoffs during a period of 
         significant profit losses.
        </p>

        <h4><strong>Case Processes</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Supreme Court Intervention (February 1): The Supreme Court stepped in decisively, issuing a 
        landmark interim order enforcing "No Work No Pay" during the strike period while mandating compulsory 
        arbitration to resolve the dispute. Critically, the court banned any mass retrenchment, providing 
        immediate job security to 18,000 employees and setting the stage for structured dispute resolution.</li>
        
        <li>National Conciliation Proceedings (February 10): A grueling 15-hour marathon negotiation session was 
        held under the Central Labour Ministry, marking the first breakthrough with a partial wage agreement 
        that addressed immediate financial concerns. However, core issues of job security and retrenchment 
        remained unresolved, necessitating formal arbitration.</li>
        
        <li>Formal Arbitration Agreement (February 15):Both parties signed a binding arbitration 
        agreement before the Chief Labour Commissioner, clearly defining the scope to cover retrenchment policies,
        pending wage revisions, and long-term job security guarantees. This agreement invoked Section 10A of the 
        Industrial Disputes Act, making the process legally enforceable.</li>
        
        <li>Comprehensive Arbitration Hearings (March 1-20):The arbitration spanned six detailed sittings over three weeks:</li>
          <li>Sittings 1-2 (March 1-5):Air India management presented extensive financial statements justifying workforce rationalization.</li>
          <li>Sittings 3-4 (March 10-15):The union countered with job security arguments and industry wage comparisons.</li>
          <li>Sitting 5 (March 18):Independent expert economists provided testimony on PSU wage structures.</li>
          <li>Sitting 6 (March 20):Final arguments were presented, completing the evidentiary phase.</li>
        
          <li>Landmark Award Publication (April 5):Justice V. Balakrishna Eradi delivered a comprehensive 120-page arbitration 
            award that became national precedent. The detailed judgement ordered nationwide implementation across Air India 
            operations and set binding terms for all PSU aviation companies, effectively resolving the crisis and protecting
             18,000 jobs.</li>
     </ul>
